					<h1>About Newslogue</h1>
					<p>
						Critical thinking is the ability to look at things from a balanced perspective without judgment or preconceived ideas. The benefits of critical thinking include:
						<ul>			
							<li>Broadening the mind</li>
							<li>Increasing and utilising analytical skills</li>
							<li>The elimination of irrational thinking (due to the focus on reasoning and rational thinking)</li>
							<li>A focus on the bigger picture (due to looking beyond the surface)</li>
							<li>Its applicability to a variety of subjects.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<p>
						At Newslogue, we encourage students to avoid taking things for granted; in today's media, 'news' can sometimes be presented as fact when it is actually opinion. We hope that our product will hone critical thinking skills, and that students will subsequently be able to identify irresponsible journalism. In recent years, the media has become a law unto itself by favouring the elite; most media has a political leaning. Journalists and—more importantly—readers alike are frequently influenced by this, finding themselves provided with only one side of an argument.
					</p>
					<p>
						Amidst an education system that is now rampant with bureaucracy, neoliberalism and meritocracy, the need for critical thinking is more important than ever. Students are taught solely to achieve grades and to maintain the status quo. Education across the western world no longer symbolises what it used to, and many schools do not encourage critical thinking.
					</p>
					<p>
						Newslogue will use news stories to increase students’ critical thinking skills. This will help them in their studies, and also in their future careers. The process is that students will write a response to questions about a specific news article. It is that simple!
					</p>
					<p>
						Newslogue is an interactive news site designed for schools and students to develop critical thinking skills, general knowledge and global awareness. The team at Newslogue are conducting market research to see how we can work with schools to build a platform that can potentially assist teachers in preparing classes and improve students’ performance.
					</p>
					<p>
						VISION
					</p>
					<p>
						Empower users to think from a different perspective
					</p>
					<p>
						VALUES
					</p>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Integrity – to be unbiased and honest. Exercising strong moral principles in everything we do.</li>
							<li>Inquisitive – constantly seeking learning opportunities to be better.</li>
							<li>Innovation – doing things differently for extraordinary results.</li>
							<li>Ownership – making things our own and taking responsibility.</li>
							<li>Open-mindedness – welcoming of new ideas and new experiences.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						Hopefully, Newslogue will encourage debating, introduce an interest in the news, refine the analytical skills of VCE students (which can be transferred to any area of study or aspect of life), aid in current VCE studies, and—of course—turn out classes of critical thinkers. Though it is only a supplement to VCE, it is ultimately intended to enhance the learning experience by shifting the focus to current global events, which would, in turn, create globally thinking students.
