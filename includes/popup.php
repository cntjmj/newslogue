				What personal information we collect
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>			
					<li>In order to register for Newslogue resources, students registering individually and not part of a school, must give their consent (or if they are under 13 years of age a parent or guardian must consent on their behalf) at the time of registration to provide us with their name, age, and their email address.

					<li>Teachers registering for their class or school must give their consent at the time of registration to provide us with their own name, class name, school name and their email address. In addition, teachers must consent for their students to participate at the time of registration and provide us with the names of their students.</li>
					<li>Registrants who do not give this consent cannot provide us with their personal information or the names of the students and cannot use the Site.</li>
					<li>We require this information in order to correctly identify each Registrant as a Site user, manage their account and for certain other purposes detailed below.</li>
				</ul>	
			</p>
			<p class="pp-sub-title">
				What we will do with your information
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>			
					<li>The information collected from Registrants is used for the following purposes:					
						<ul>
							<li>to send a confirmation notice to the Registrant of the registration;</li>
							<li>upon the Registrant’s request, to reset a password for a lost or forgotten password;</li>
							<li>to respond to any questions, concerns or problems raised by the Registrant;</li>
							<li>to contact the Registrant about any problems with the Registrant’s account or conduct on the Site;</li>
							<li>to send out a Newslogue newsletter or emails about the Site;</li>
							<li>to publish the names of winners and high performers on the Site or in the Newslogue newsletter and to provide all the results data for each Registrant;</li>
							<li>to send prizes or certificates for participation and performance on the Site.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Newslogue is unique in the sense that there are numerous special events that keep the Site constantly fresh, challenging, fun and interesting for our Registrants.</li>
					<li>We use the Newslogue product newsletters or emails to notify our users of all the current events, changes, improvements, upgrades, rules, and so on, of the Site. In addition, we may notify our Registrants of new products and services that Newslogue has designed and made available to the Registrants. In all communications, Registrants may opt out at any time by following the specific opt out instructions within the communications that we send.</li>
				</ul>	
			</p>
			<p class="pp-sub-title">
				What we will not do with your personal information
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>			
					<li>Newslogue will keep your personal information confidential and not sell or knowingly divulge your information to advertisers or any external third parties, unless:					
						<ul>
							<li>we are required to share your information with a third party in order to comply with law or to comply with a court order or subpoena;</li>
							<li>to enforce our website or event rules; or</li>
							<li>to protect the safety and security of our Registrants and our Site.</li>							
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Generally we will only use your information within Newslogue. However, sometimes we provide data on results to government education departments, peak bodies managing or representing schools, or schools themselves. We will require these third parties to comply strictly with our instructions and we will require that they do not have access to your personal information and not use the data for commercial purposes.</li>
				</ul>	
			</p>
			<p class="pp-sub-title">
				How we process your information
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>			
					<li>We ask for Registrants’ consent to the use of any personal information we collect from them in accordance with our Privacy Policy at the time of registration. If a Registrant does not wish to provide us with their consent, they cannot agree to the Site Terms and Conditions and must not use the Site.</li>
					<li>Our use of the personal information we collect is necessary in order for us to maintain the Site and facilitate Registrants’ use of the Site. We do not collect any unnecessary personal data from Registrants (for instance, their race or religious beliefs).</li>
				</ul>	
			</p>
			<p class="pp-sub-title">
				How long we hold your information
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>			
					<li>We will keep any personal information we collect from Registrants for as long as they are registered users of the Site. If a Registrant cancels their registration or it otherwise lapses after 3 years of not using the Site, we will only keep their personal information for the purposes of sending the Registrant information regarding Newslogue’s other products and services if they agree to receive this information. Personal information is otherwise deleted or destroyed.</li>					
				</ul>	
			</p>
			<p class="pp-sub-title">
				Keeping your personal information accurate
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>			
					<li>The personal information we hold about a Registrant (such as their name, address and school) is kept so that we may correctly identify that Registrant. Registrants can update their personal information at anytime by contacting Newslogue (details below).</li>					
				</ul>	
			</p>
			<p class="pp-sub-title">
				Keeping your personal information secure
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>			
					<li>Newslogue is committed to information security. We will use all reasonable endeavours to keep Registrants’ personal information in a secure environment. For instance, each Registrant’s personal information is encrypted whilst being sent to our server at the time of registration. However, security cannot be guaranteed due to the nature of the internet.</li>					
					<li>Newslogue’s security measures are designed to assist in Registrants’ personal information not being accessed by unauthorised personnel, lost or misused. If you reasonably believe that there has been an unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information please let us know by contacting our Privacy and Data Protection Officer (contact details below).</li>					
				</ul>	
			</p>
			<p class="pp-sub-title">
				Anonymous information
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>			
					<li>In addition to personal information and results data, Newslogue also collects anonymous information about Registrants and the activities of Registrants on the Site. Anonymous information is information that is not linked to the name of a user. This information is used to assist us in enhancing the learning resources and the information remains anonymous at all times.</li>					
					<li>When agreeing to the Site Terms and Conditions, Registrants grant Newslogue the right to use this anonymous information for its own purposes, such as the preparation of statistical reports, provided Newslogue otherwise complies with its obligations in respect of the use of personal information.</li>															
				</ul>	
			</p>
			<p class="pp-sub-title">
				Revision of Privacy Policy
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>			
					<li>Newslogue reserves the right to change, modify, or revise this Privacy Policy in order to comply with any applicable laws or for any other reason at any time. Therefore our Registrants are required to check the Privacy Policy periodically to read about any changes, modifications, or revisions. Registrants may wish to check it each time they submit personal information. You will be deemed to have consented to such variation by your continued use of the Site following any changes being made.</li>										
				</ul>	
			</p>
			<p class="pp-sub-title">
				How can parents access, change or delete personally identifiable information about their child?
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>			
					<li>Registrants have a right to get a copy from us of the personal information we hold about them. If you wish to receive a copy of this information please address your request to the Privacy and Data Protection Officer (contact details below). We will deal with your request promptly and in any case at least within 45 days of the date of receiving it. We will correct or delete inaccurate or incomplete personal information we hold about you at your request.</li>										
				</ul>	
			</p>
			<p class="pp-sub-title">
				Public Displays of Names
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>			
					<li>Newslogue strives to provide highly engaging websites for students. Given students have indicated their strong preference for their name to be shown publicly, in recognition of their achievements, we allow this – but we do not allow full names (ie First Name and Surname) to be shown publicly.</li>										
					<li style="font-style: italic;">All administrative user access to any Newslogue Site permits the full anonymising of names, where preferred by the user.</li>										
				</ul>	
			</p>
			<p class="pp-sub-title">
				Cookies
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>			
					<li>A cookie is a little piece of information handed to a web browser from a web server that contains information that can be retrieved from the server later. When you visit the Site the server may attach a cookie to your computer’s memory. Newslogue uses cookies only to the limited extent to recognise the Registrant when they visit the Site and pairing that Registrant with the account (and account preferences) that the Registrant created. However, this information is not linked to any personal information that Registrant may provide and cannot be used to identify Registrants. You should be able to configure your computer so that it disables cookies.</li>										
					<li>To help us better understand you needs and better share content, we also use analytical software. This software will save a cookie to your computers hard drive in order to track and monitor your engagement and usage of the website but will not store, save or collect personal information. You can read Google’s privacy policy here for further information.</li>										
					<li>Other cookies may be stored to your computers hard drive when this website uses referral programs, sponsored links or adverts – which is extremely rare. Such cookies typically expire after 30 days, though some may take longer. No personal information is stored, saved or collected without your consent.</li>															
				</ul>	
			</p>
			<p class="pp-sub-title">
				Transfer of your data
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>			
					<li>Registrants’ personal information is uploaded to and kept on servers that we maintain or that are maintained by third parties that comply with strict contractual privacy obligations. It is not otherwise transferred internationally except where a copy is sent to the Registrant itself at their request. Registrants must consent for their personal information to be transferred and stored in this manner at the time of registration.</li>										
				</ul>	
			</p>
			<p class="pp-sub-title">
				Special Notice To Parents
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>			
					<li>Newslogue has no intention of seeking personal information about minors who visit our Web Sites. If such information is collected, this Privacy Statement will apply to that information. In addition, if we can identify a user as a minor, the personal information will not be used for further marketing and promotion unless the minor’s guardian has consented. We encourage you to ask your children to seek your permission before providing information about themselves or their family over the Internet.</li>										
				</ul>	
			</p>
			<p class="pp-sub-title">
				Special Notice To Children
